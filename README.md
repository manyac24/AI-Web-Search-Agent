<h1 align="center">Welcome to AI-Web-Search-Agent ðŸ‘‹</h1>

</p>

The AI Web Search Agent is a tool designed to automate data retrieval and extraction tasks by leveraging web search capabilities.
Given a dataset (in CSV or Google Sheets format), the AI agent reads specific entities in a chosen column, performs web searches for each, and uses a language model (LLM) to parse relevant information based on user-defined queries. The structured output can then be viewed in a simple dashboard interface and downloaded for further analysis and also added to the google sheet.
